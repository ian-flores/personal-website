I assist clients in the deployment of RStudio Pro Products on-premises and cloud environments. As part of this assistance I like to focus on clients who integrate Kubernetes and Docker to their stack of RStudio Pro Products and I also enjoy troubleshooting deployments with Python environments. As part of my responsabilities I also develop and maintain R packages focused around infrastructure management; write support articles and blog posts about the latest technologies at the intersection of data science and infrastructure and work as a liaison between the Solutions Engineering and Product teams.
