I developed an open source Shiny application to visualize expenses from the Government of Puerto Rico. (https://github.com/ian-flores/TransparenciaFinanciera) I also worked for the Puerto Rico Violent Death Reporting System, a surveillance system in collaboration with the CDC and hosted by the Institute of Statistics. As part of my collaboration with the System, I produced reports with RMarkdown reducing report-generation time from 6 hours to 15 minutes. I also implemented a database migration from on-premise MS SQL Server to a cloud CouchDB instance deployed in Amazon Web Services. I had within my responsabilities the maintainance and completion of a React application used for data collection purposes ensuring data quality through the UX. Within the scope of this work I documented the data infrastructure for technical and non-technical stakeholders.
