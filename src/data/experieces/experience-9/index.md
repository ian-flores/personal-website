I automatized the process of creating Virtual Machines for training purposes using Packer, Ansible, Docker Compose and GitLabCI in a Digital Ocean environment. I also deployed data science infrastructure such as RStudio Professional Products in Amazon Web Services using Terraform. As well, I administered RStudio Connect, RStudio Package Manager and RStudio Server Pro instances for clients in the pharmaceutical and media industries. As part of my responsabilities I developed R packages and Shiny apps for Systems Administration.
